The sample code serves as an example on how to interact with the MSRC SSI API through C#, Python, Ruby and Powershell. You will need to log into the MSRC Portal and obtain an API key.

<h2>Code Example Directions</h2>

<h3>C#</h3>
To use the C# example code you will need to copy the code into your project or solution because the C# example code file is not a runnable solution.  There is a tutorial for this under the C# example folder in the CARS section.

<h3>Powershell</h3>
To use the powershell module, download the Powershell-Example-Code.Ps1 file and run it using a Powershell console, Command Line, or by right-clicking on the file and selecting "Run With Powershell".  Then input your API-Key and your personalized JSON body that you filled out from the PowershellBody.txt file it will attempt to post to the engage API.  There is a tutorial for this under the PowerShell example folder in the CARS section.

If you are running via command line, you will need to call it like so:

<b>C:\Users\username> powershell -noexit "yourFilePath"</b>

<h3>Python</h3>
