<h2>Pentest Overview</h2>

These code samples show how to use the API for submitting customer-driven Azure Penetration Testing Notifications to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC).

This action allows you to notify Microsoft of any planned penetration tests against your Azure assets.
While doing so is optional, Microsoft will review submissions associated with your subscription in the course of troubleshooting issues.
This request information also helps us collect metrics which we use to improve the security and availability of the Azure Platform.
This request does *not* serve to enable or disable any platform security measures or alter any security detections.
Many security controls such as Azure Network Security groups are under direct customer control.
Automated platform security measures such as those which protect Software as a Service (SaaS) applications cannot be disabled.

Penetration Test Notification Process:

1. **Request**.
Please provide as complete data as you can. Should your plans change, simply submit a new notification with updated information.
This will supersede your previous submission.

2. **Acknowledgment**.
Once the form is submitted, the Azure Safeguards Team will send an automated acknowledgement to the provided contact email
*and* the owners of the subscription. This email is your one and only confirmation from Microsoft.

3. **Testing**.
You may only conduct tests which abide by the [Microsoft Cloud Unified Penetration Testing Rules of Engagement](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/mt784683).
No exceptions to the rules of engagement will be granted.

If you have other questions about penetration testing or the status of your notification, you can reach us at [Azure Support](https://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/support/).

Note that to use this API (and any of these samples), you will need to log into the [MSRC Portal](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/developer) and obtain an API key on the Developer tab.

<h2>Using the Code Samples</h2>

<h3>C#</h3>
To use the C# example code, you will need to copy the code into your project or solution because the C# example code file is not a runnable solution. Instructions for creating a new solution are included in a tutorial in the CARS folder.

<h3>Powershell</h3>
To use the PowerShell module, download the Powershell-Example-Code.Ps1 file and run it using a PowerShell console, command line, or by right-clicking on the file and selecting "Run With Powershell." Then input your API key and the personalized JSON body that you filled out from the PowershellBody.txt file, and it will attempt to post to the MSRC Engage API.

If you are running this script via the command line, you will need to call it like so:

<b>C:\Users\username> powershell -noexit "yourFilePath"</b>

<h3>Python</h3>
To use the Python code example, you will need to copy and paste the code into your project because the Python example code file is not runnable as-is.

<h3>Ruby</h3>
To use the Ruby code example, you will need to copy and paste the code into your project because the Ruby example code file is not runnable as-is.

<h3>Curl</h3>
To use the Curl code example, you will need to copy and paste the code into your project because the Curl example code file is not runnable as-is.

<h3>Java</h3>
To use the Java code example, you will need to copy and paste the code into your project because the Java example code file is not runnable as-is.

<h3>JavaScript</h3>
To use the JavaScript code example, you can copy the code into a text editor that runs JS (e.g., VS Code) or you can download the file and run it using that text editor.

<h3>Objective C</h3>
To use the Objective C code example, you will need to copy and paste the code into your project because the ObjC example code file is not runnable as-is.

<h3>PHP</h3>
To use the PHP code sample, you can either copy and paste the code into an existing PHP project, or you can download and run the file as a PHP file with your IDE.
