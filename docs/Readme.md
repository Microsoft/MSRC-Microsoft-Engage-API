It uses the [OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) 2.0, also known as Swagger 2.0, to create a machine-readable definition in JSON and YAML formats. A clean and interactive UI for this API can be auto-generated using SmartBear's Swagger UI [Live Demo](https://petstore.swagger.io); simply paste the [raw API definition](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/MSRC-Microsoft-Engage-API/master/docs/swagger.json) into the top bar and click "explore."
