# Welcome
Microsoft provides APIs for automation of submitting various security reports. The Engage API  is a great place to report Abuse, Penetration Testing activity or submit Service Security Issues.  The Portal (https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/engage) is where individual reports should be submitted.  To submit bulk reports, you may want to call the Engage API directly on the developer portal (https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/developer).

This project contains sample code and documentation for the Microsoft 
Engage API (https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/developer), including:

1. <b>Abuse reports</b> originating from Microsoft Online Services, such as Microsoft Azure, Bing, Outlook, One Drive, and Office 365. This includes malicious network activity originating from a Microsoft IP addresses.
2. Azure Service customer-driven <b>penetration testing notifications</b> in a derivative of the CARS (Cloud Abuse Reporting Schema) as JSON
3. Microsoft <b>Service Security Issues</b>, such as security misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and other security related issues.
